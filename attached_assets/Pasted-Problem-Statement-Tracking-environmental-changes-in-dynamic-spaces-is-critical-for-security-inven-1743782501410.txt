Problem Statement
Tracking environmental changes in dynamic spaces is critical
for security, inventory management, and space optimization.
Existing methods rely on manual inspection or resourceintensive processing, making real-time monitoring inefficient.
The challenge is to develop an AI-powered application that
enables users to scan a space, detect differences in
subsequent scans, and provide actionable insights in an
optimized and user-friendly manner.
Challenge:
Develop an AI-powered application capable of detecting and
highlighting changes in dynamic spaces by comparing
sequential scans. The solution should efficiently process room
scans, identify differences, and provide actionable insights while
running on mobile or edge devices.
Context Open innovation
Tracking environmental changes is crucial for various
industries, including security, inventory management, and
space optimization. Businesses need a lightweight, efficient, and
user-friendly tool to detect modifications in spaces such as
hotel rooms, offices, warehouses, or retail shelves. Traditional
methods for monitoring changes rely on manual inspection or
resource-intensive processing, creating a need for an AI-driven,
real-time alternative.
Primary Objectives:
Initial Room Mapping: Enable users to scan and create a
baseline reference of a pace, storing structural and objectrelated information.
Change Detection: Identify and categorize new, removed, or
repositioned objects upon subsequent scans.Optimized Room Processing: Minimize computational load
by focusing only on areas with detected changes instead of
reprocessing the entire space.
Custom Lightweight Model: Develop an AI model optimized
for mobile or edge devices, ensuring efficient performance.
User-Friendly Visualization: Provide an interactive UI/UX
with visual indicators of detected changes.
Bonus Features
Object Categorization & Smart Alerts: Classify objects and
generate alerts for specific changes (e.g., security alerts for
missing items).
Multi-Scan Analysis: Track long-term changes across
multiple scans and analyze usage patterns over time.
Integration with External Systems: Allow integration with
inventory management, security systems, or facility
management tools for enhanced automation.
